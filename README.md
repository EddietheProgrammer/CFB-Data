# CFB-Data
Open Source College Football Data since 2014

Unfortunately, my timeouts are a little off for some games as I forgot to account for when the down is NaN (an injury timeout). The csvs are pretty accurate nonetheless, but I'm going to work on another project in the meantime. Maybe will come back to this and make a package for cfb data.
